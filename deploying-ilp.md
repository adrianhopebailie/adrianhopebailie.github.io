# Deploying Interoperable Payments Systems
_A payment network operators guide to the Interledger protocol._

## Background

The Interledger Protocol (ILP) is an internetworking protocol for payment networks. It's design focuses on simplicity and draws inspiration from the architecture of the Internet to define a simple interoperability layer that abstracts away the mechanics of different underlying payment networks.

To acheive this ILP defines some basic standards and operating protocols that must be deployed to any underlying network. In the absence of these ILP payments can still be made over the network but only wehere network participants agree to establish an overlay network of trust-relationships that are independant of the network.

## Motivation

Interoperability is key to market competition. As proven by the Internet
